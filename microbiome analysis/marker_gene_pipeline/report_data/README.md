# `report_data` directory

This directory contains scripts for generating report data for a client's sample compared to baseline samples.

## Overview

- `compute_diversity_score.py`: Computes a diversity score by comparing a sample's kmer Shannon entropy to a set of baseline entropies.

- `compute_probiotic_scores.py`: Computes probiotic taxa scores by comparing a sample's probiotic abundances to a set of baseline probiotic abundances.

- `compute_functional_scores.py`: Computes functional scores by comparing a sample's functional abundances to a set of baseline functional abundances.

- `format_taxonomy_report_data.py`: Generates formatted taxonomy report data for a client's sample.

- `data`: Directory containing data files used by the report data scripts.
